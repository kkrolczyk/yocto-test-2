# TODO = actually other layer should specify available images... given it contains them

Available images:
* jucr-image-base
* jucr-image-test
* jucr-image-prod

Build them by running: bitbake <image>

 you can use the following download and sstate cache mirror   http:// xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx vpn?
which heavily improves fetch and build times.

To activate

cat << EOF >> conf/site.conf
INHERIT += "own-mirrors"
SOURCE_MIRROR_URL = "http://xxxxx.net/downloads/"
SSTATE_MIRRORS = "file://.* http://xxxxx.net/sstate-cache/PATH"
EOF
